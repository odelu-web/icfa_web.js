                  <h4>Having the Cake and Eating It Too</h4>
                  <p>
                    “You can't have your cake and eat it too” they say. But it
                    happens sometimes, rarely though. Curious to know?
                    Entrepreneurship ideas stem from passion or possession (say
                    family business). For ideas to turn entities proper
                    implementation is a must. MBA degree gains relevance here.
                    Online MBA for Entrepreneurs provides the insights to carry
                    through the ideas. You have the cake and eat it too! Online
                    MBA (ICFAI Online MBA intended) model suits best in this
                    context as it offers a perfect work-study balance.
                  </p>
                  <h4>How does MBA add value for an entrepreneur?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Passion cannot be taught, says psychologists. It could be
                    true too. But there can't be a disagreement that it can be
                    improved. The tool for this improvement is the MBA program.
                    Let’s see a case in point. Your venture is working healthy.
                    But someday you find that it is not heading in the desired
                    direction. The question will be what next? MBA sets a
                    problem solving state of mind through its case studies.
                    There are some more benefits:

                    <li>
                      Helps the entrepreneurs to wear different hats
                      comfortablly: E.g. functions like HR, communication, and
                      interpersonal skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Imparts confidence to the entrepreneur to take the
                      critical decision on business development and pivoting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Provide opportunity for networking with peers and experts
                      which stands you in good stead during crises.

                            Gurpreet is the scioness of a renowned jewellery
                            brand that claims a legacy of three generations.
                            Unique traditional hand crafted jewellery is their
                            USP. Eventhough the brand has been able to gain
                            loyalty through its heritage, Gurpreet felt that
                            more needs to be done to drive the future sales. She
                            completed her masters in gemmology and business
                            management. She pins high hopes on this
                            qualification, MBA in particular. We could engage
                            her in a brief conversation recently. Excerpts:

                            Can MBA degree be the key to make your professional
                            dreams come true? Here's an interesting read.
                          </p>
                          <p className="mb-1">
                            It was after a long interlude that I caught up with
                            Kiran recently. We both used to be regulars at
                            social gatherings, before the social distancing
                            became the norm. All of a sudden, handshakes
                            succumbed to virtual Hi's and hugs conceded to
                            reluctant hand-folds. Our social calendars thus
                            became a blank sheet.
                          </p>
                          <p className="mb-1">
                            For the inquisitives, Kiran is a smart medical
                            doctor; hospital's pride and peers' envy. And he
                            happily worked and enjoyed his life. A normal story
                            would have ended thus. But the climax here has a
                            different twist. All because of Kiran's drive to
                            embrace the change. He was agile and innovative too.
                            He always looked at things in a larger
                            organisational perspective. It was obvious, Kiran
                            was created to be a doctor and an entrepreneur;
                            rather a doctor-entrepreneur. He studied management
                            as he worked. The MBA degree stood him in good stead
                            here.
                          </p>
                          <p className="mb-1">
                            I just recalled Kiran's words “Every day when I
                            walked past our CEO's cabin, I used to make a head
                            trip to be sitting in his chair.” I cautioned him
                            that it involved a lot of betting on himself. But he
                            was already there.
                          </p>
                          <p className="mb-1">
                            To make the long story short, Kiran has achieved
                            what he is made to be. He now owns a 100 plus bed
                            hospital. The tell-tale glow was evident on his
                            face. His treat is pending.
