                      You have an exciting job; enjoy a great work environment
                      and take home a handsome pay. Yet you're not in the best
                      of spirits. Some void chases you all the time. Do these
                      reflections match you? Then you're not into that right job
                      fit yet. It is time to make the move - a career

                    <p className="mb-1">
                      Your finish line, the right career fit, is defined. What
                      remains is the pursuit that takes you there. Dressing for
                      the job you want, however, is a daunting task. It could
                      mean a fight to the finish or ceding the fortunes
                      (intended for career progression and shift). Nevertheless,
                      as the saying goes, “It is better to fit out before you
                      step out” (of your comfort zone). It is here the
                      reskilling counts.

                    <p>
                      In management parlance, reskilling is synonymous with MBA.
                      MBA validates the commitment to learning, improving and
                      applying skills that translate themselves into success
                      stories. For working professional, ICFAI Online MBA is the
                      best bet as it offers an amazing work-study balance.

                            Vidya is a design engineer with a multinational.
                            Hard hatters who always chase the deadlines, design
                            engineers hardly get a time split to pursue
                            passions. But Vidya belongs to a different matrix.
                            She nurtures an unflagging ambition to become a
                            business leader. She manages time outs to pursue
                            management learning. That helped her too. She’s now
                            the country head of the company. But her journey
                            doesn’t stop here. Let’s walk the talk with Vidya
                          </p>
                          <h6>
                            How did the MBA program help you, especially in the
                            context that you are a hard core engineer?
                          </h6>
                          <p>
                            I did not want to limit myself to a career that
                            solely used my technical skills. I was determined to
                            find a path that took me from engineer to leader.
                            The MBA program certainly helped me to get this
                            progression.
                          </p>
                          <h6>
                            So management degree gives an edge to an engineer?
                          </h6>
                          <p>
                            Certainly, unless you don’t want to get stuck in the
                            groove. By doing MBA, one learns managerial skills,
                            one learns how to get on with the teams.
                          </p>
                          <h6>
                            What could the career prospects of an engineer
                            leader be?
                          </h6>
                          <p>
                            The MBA is often seen a way to switch careers
                            fields, not just positions. With specific technical
                            know- how you could change positions but the job you
                            perform remains more or less the same. Business
                            knowledge applies to industries across. So your
                            career progression is facilitated.

                            dreams come true? Here’s an interesting read.

                            It was after a long interlude that I caught up with
                            Kiran recently. We both used to be regulars at
                            social gatherings, before the social distancing
                            became the norm. All of a sudden, handshakes
                            succumbed to virtual Hi’s and hugs conceded to
                            reluctant hand-folds. Our social calendars thus
                            became a blank sheet. For the inquisitives, Kiran is
                            a smart medical doctor; hospital’s pride and peers’
                            envy. And he happily worked and enjoyed his life. A
                            normal story would have ended thus. But the climax
                            here has a different twist. All because of Kiran’s
                            drive to embrace the change. He was agile and
                            innovative too. He always looked at things in a
                            larger organisational perspective. It was obvious,
                            Kiran was created to be a doctor and an
                            entrepreneur; rather a doctor-entrepreneur. He
                            studied management as he worked. The MBA degree
                            stood him in good stead here.
                          </p>

                            I just recalled Kiran’s words “Every day when I
                            walked past our CEO’s cabin, I used to make a head
                            trip to be sitting in his chair.” I cautioned him
