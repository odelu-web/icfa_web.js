                    “Learning is run on questions” they say. The big question
                    that catches up with the MBA dilemma of many fresh grads
                    these days is “Should we or shouldn't we ?” (Pursue online
                    MBA course now). The puzzle apart, one feels the question
                    itself tells us how important the management degree is.
                    Otherwise why should the MBA get into your mind at all?
                    Nevertheless don't get caught behind. Let's see a more
                    precise picture.

                            what you are passionate about. Hitherto various
                            factors like parental pressure or peers advice could
                            have influenced your course of studies. But here’s
                            the fallback (perhaps never after) chance to turn to

                            crucial milestone in your academic journey. This is
                            not the only reason why an MBA degree is the best
                            fit for a fresher:

                              <strong>Renjith:</strong> Hi Rekha, so you are

                            </p>

                              to pursue an MBA ? People say MBA is not for
                              freshers.

                              Irfan was in a dilemma, like many of us, whether
                              to join MBA course after his graduation from a
                              tier-2 college. His main concern was about the
                              placement, as many of his friends told him that
                              MBA does not add much value to the pay package for
                              a fresher. But Irfan decided to take the plunge.
                              He pursued MBA and now is happily employed with a
                              multinational.
